# Spring Boot backend as OpenID Connect Resource Server for SPA
This repo demonstrates how to set up a Spring Boot application to act as a resource server for a SPA (an Angular one in this case).  
The SPA handles authentication and authorization through a (third party) OpenID Provider (OP). The backend is a relying party (RP).
You must configure an OP yourself. This app will use GitHub as an OP for demonstration purposes.
